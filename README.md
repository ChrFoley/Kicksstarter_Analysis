# Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

### Challenge Week 1

#### Methodology

Outcomes of kickstarter campaigns for Plays are affected by measurable factors. Specifically analyzed are:

1) Outcomes driven by the Kickstarter campaign goal 
2) Outcomes driven by the kickstarter launch date. 

#### Report

The overall monetary goal of the Kickstarter campaign did have a impact on the probable outcome. Lower target goals had a greater propensity to be achieved when compared to higher target goals. For example, Plays with goals of less than $1000, met their intended target at a rate of 76% (Fig 1). Data show that there is a steady decline in the percentage. Fig 1. shows that failed kickstarter campaigns surpass those that were successful when the goal increased to the range of $20,000 - $24,999. There are two ranges that present as outliers. Goals ranges of $35,000 - $39,999 and $40,000 - $44,999 both showed more successful than failed Kickstarter campaigns. The overall downward trend as the target goal increases still indicates that the higher the target, the higher the probability of failure.  

Launch date also had an impact and is easily seen in the line chart (FIG 3). Earlier launch dates showed a greater success rate than later launches. In Fig. 3, the early launches of Theater Kickstarter campaigns have shown to be very successful, until APR 2014, all campaigns in this category successfully met their goals. Retroactively, there is little that can be done to rectify the numbers of started or active campaigns. During this same time period, the overall number of campaigns increased significantly. 

Additionally, the time of year has a significant effect on the overall out come. Campaigns launched after the new year (01 JAN) showed a much higher likelihood of being successful. Crossing of data points in Fig 3 during the latter part of the year shows a lower propensity of monetary pledges. 

The overall number of campaigns begining also has an effect. There are peaks and valleys that correlate launch dates with both successful and failed Kickstarter campaigns. WHen density is relatively high, the success and failure rate both decline in concert.

#### Conclusions 

  1) Target Goal 
    a) Success rate, Lower goals are more often met
    b) the majority of successful campaigns have below $20,000 campaign goals 
  2) Launch Date 
    a) Launch date has a visible impact when looked at by the time of year.
    b) Earlier Kickstarters were more successful overall
    
### Recommendations
  1) Choose a campaign launch date that is in the first quarter of the calendar year. 
  2) Establish realistic monetary goals, more is not always better.
      a) Goals less than $20,000 show the most desired campaign outcomes.
  3) Monitor the numbers of launched and active campaigns and plan to launch when density is low, or begins increasing.
    
###### Limitations

  1) Analysis is limited to a small segment of the overall dataset. 
  2) Density of those campaigns with high goals are minimal. greter density in this area would yield more accurate results.
  3) Currency is not specified, if each unit is a differnt currency are the results actually comparable. ie. 1 Dollar does not equal 1 Euro
  4) the data set does not take into consideration the subject matter of the play. Is the play fiction, non-fiction, culturally appropriate, or trendy.

##### Future Analysis
  1) Analyze the number of pledges in order to pattern the average donation. This shows if results are skewed by a small number of large donors.
  2) Analyze other parent categories, if data correlates with time of year then it shows a larger trend within a larger portion of the industry.
  3) Analyze the length of time specified for the Kickstarter campaign. does a well planned campaign with a longer timeline show better results.
