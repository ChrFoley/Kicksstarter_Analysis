# Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

### Challenge Week 1

#### Methodology

Outcomes of kickstarter campaigns for Plays are affected by measurable factors. Specifically analyzed are:

1) Outcomes driven by the Kickstarter campaign goal 
2) Outcomes driven by the kickstarter launch date. 

#### Report

The overall monetary goal of the Kickstarter campaign did have a impact on the probable outcome. Lower target goals had a greater propensity to be achieved when compared to higher target goals. For example, Plays with goals of less than $1000, met their intended goals at a rate of 76% (Fig 1). Data show that there is a steady decline in the percentage. Fig 1. shows that failed kickstarter campaigns surpass those that were successful when the goal increased to the range of $20,000 - $24,999. there are two ranges that present as outliers. Goals ranges of $35,000 - $39,999 and $40,000 - $44,999 both showed more successful than failed Kickstarter campaigns. The overall downward trend as the target goal increases still indicates that the higher the target, the higher the probability of failure.  

Launch date also had an impact and is easily seen in the line chart (FIG 3).

#### Conclusion  

  1) Target Goal 
    a) Success rate - At higher goals, there is much lower densities, therefore success may be less acurate. 
  2) Launch Date 
    a) Launch date has a visible impact when looked at by the time of year.
    b) Earlier Kickstarters were more successful overall
